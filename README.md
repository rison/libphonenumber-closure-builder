Here also have created two directory:   
*   one named closure-compiler, which store compiler.jar  
*   another named closure-library, which created using "git clone https://code.google.com/p/closure-library/"  

Install python 2.7, calcdeps.py cannot work with paython 3.3.

By doing so, phonenumbers-build.bat could generate phonenumbers-compiled.js
